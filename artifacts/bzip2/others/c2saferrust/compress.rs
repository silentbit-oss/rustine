      The first thing to do is generate the MTF values,
      and put them in
         ((UInt16*)s->arr1) [ 0 .. s->nblock-1 ].
      Because there are strictly fewer or equal MTF values
      than block values, ptr values in this area are overwritten
      with MTF values only when they are no longer needed.

      The final compressed bitstream is generated into the
      area starting at
         (UChar*) (&((UChar*)s->arr2)[s->nblock])

      These storage aliases are set up in bzCompressInit(),
